# Neural_Network

In this project we will build a model that will attempt to predict whether or not someone will pay back their loan based on historical information.
We will be using a subset of the LendingClub DataSet obtained from Kaggle.
LendingClub is a US peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California.It was the first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and to offer loan trading on a secondary market. LendingClub is the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform.
LendingClub gives loans to people and they have to pay back that loan with an interest rate. Sometimes, the people don't pay back their loan and the company has to 
record that as a charge off.
Given historical data on loans ( with information on whether the borrower has a charge off), we want to build a model that can predict whether or not a
borrower will pay back the loan.This way, in the future,when we have a new potential customer we can asses whether or not they are likely to pay back the loan.
